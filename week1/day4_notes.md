[SMART Goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tcw_8OuOSXArP8Wr7X1jywWDV8NW_LzYmFawUCBYIZ8/edit)

The goals for this week are:

* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

Much progress has already been made towards the first three and I will have more pairing opportunities this afternoon and tomorrow, so today I will focus on OO principles such as encapsulation and the single responsibility principle.

I will use the Makers resources, in particular the encapsulation and cohesion practical and skills workshop. If there is time left over I will work on the Udemy RSpec course.

I will know whether I have improved if I can understand and explain SRP and encapsulation to my pair programmer this afternoon.
