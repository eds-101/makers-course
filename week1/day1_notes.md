## How to thrive at Makers

You wonâ€™t finish most work at Makers. You are here to learn, not complete things.

* Ask for help
* Take care of your sleep â€“ it is extremely important
* Time will pass quickly â€“ milk the experience, make use of the facilities etc
* Be yourself
* Weekend challenges â€“ start early, seek help from coaches, mentor etc. Be patient with yourself
* Donâ€™t compare yourself to others. Ignore the imposter syndrome! Keep growth mindset in mind
* Working with new people everyday. Enjoy the pairing, take positives from it
* There will be times when you or others are stressed, itâ€™s also fine to be fine
* Trust the process!
* Socialising is important ðŸ˜Š
* Makers is not about finding certainty, itâ€™s more like learning to surf
* Emotional intelligence â€“ we all experience emotions. Can train your EQ. We all have shame etc.

### Train attention

* Train focus by having an object you can train on such as breathing
* Mindfulness meditation. Do this 10 minutes a day â€“ there is a long-term impact. Best time is shortly after waking up (RPM â€“ rise, pee, meditate) but it can be good in the evening to help sleep. For better results, do it twice a day

## Meet the Coaches

Alice â€“ Head of Coaching

Tatsiana Ivonchyk â€“ worked as back-end engineer at Monzo, has been at Makers for a year. Worked mainly with Go, Python

Eoin (pronounced Owen) is main coach.

Alex is technical coach, shadowing Eoin for first week of the course. Worked at LexisNexis prior to Makers. C#, Python, JavaScript, some other unusual languages

Ben â€“ has been at Makers for year and a half, was a Makers student 5 years ago. CSS

Leo Hetsch â€“ was working with different companies/startups on freelance projects. Has been at Makers for a few months. Ruby, PHP, Javascript, Go, Elixir

Career path â€“ donâ€™t worry too much about front-end, back-end, full stack etc. The skills you learn at Makers means you can choose to change path later. Course material is focussed on full stack. Will find out about many other possibilities later in the course.

## What to focus on?

* Reflect on a schedule â€“ write every day/week
* Learning, not completion. What do I want to achieve today and what resources will I use to achieve that?
* Break things down into smaller steps

## Succeeding at Makers

Success = the achievement of oneâ€™s goal or aim

Weekly outlines on github â€“ will be pinned on slack

Weekly calendar

Contact coaches for help, i.e. talking through one of the weekâ€™s goals

Set goals for the week

Weekend challenges are designed to be done solo. Make notes of progress, difficulties, where you got stuck etc so we can discuss them on Monday

Self-led learning â€“ you take the initiative in diagnosing learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying materials, choosing and implementing learning strategies and evaluating learning outcomes.

Differences between this style of learning and being taught:

* More personal accountability
* Take responsibility for own learning, tailor it towards your own needs â€“ how youâ€™re learning, not just what youâ€™re learning
* More powerful/empowering, more rewarding. You learn how to think, not what to think
* Weâ€™re all choosing to be here
* Be more accepting while pairing
* Gratification â€“ in structured learning, that comes from the teacher rather than yourself
* Not being expected to finish something is very different to traditional learning
* Application rather than learning. Errors are a good thing, you learn a lot from them
* Need to proactively seek feedback on learning and progress

[Why use independent learners?](https://blog.makersacademy.com/why-we-build-independent-learners-b16de5201a79)

* Pace of change â€“ tech field constantly changing
* To be an adult is to be independent
* Better learning than teacher-directed

How does it work?

* Decide what to aim for (your goal)
* Determine how you get there (your plan)
* Get insight into your progress (self-assessment)

Roles

* Learner â€“ setting the agenda. Focus on you, not what everyone else is doing. Attend course full time, take part in projects and assignments, work towards the goals of the course, frequently seek feedback
* Cohort â€“ support, sharing experience, relieving stress, knowing youâ€™re not alone etc.
* Coach â€“ support, guidance, facilitation.
Will learn how to interact with coaches later this week. Mornings is open for coaching time.
Escalation process:
* Follow debugging process [Makers pill](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/debugging.md)
* Describe your problem (keywords, context, diagrams, errors)
* Bounce ideas off your pair partner
* Google!
* Slack cohort channel
* Coaches channel
