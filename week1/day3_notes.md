_Learning how to collaborate on github_

This is a core skill - I need to be able to do this fluently to pair program.

I will:

* Read through the learning material from Makers
* Practice this morning with Ian Mc
* Implement the skills this afternoon when pair programming on the boris bikes project

The afternoon's work will also help towards the weekly goals of learning TDD.

### Notes

#### Setting Goals

SMART goals

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Realistic
* Time-constrained

#### Git collaboration

[Makers skills workshop](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/blob/master/practicals/git_collaboration.md)

[Makers pre-course git collaboration pill](https://makersacademy.teachable.com/courses/makers-academy-mastery-precourse/lectures/3989138)

[GitHub Docs: inviting collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)

Inviting a collaborator to a github project is pretty easy - in the settings menu there is a manage access tab where you can invite people to collaborate on a project

The process is fairly straightforward - once a repo is set up and a commit has been pushed to it, the owner invites someone to collaborate. They need to accept the invitation and then **clone** the repo.

You then push/pull commits to and from the repo as you pair program.

If pairing with another person the next day, then we need to create a different repo to avoid messing with someone else's repo. You will have lots of repos lying around but these can be cleaned up later on in the course.

#### Afternoon pairing

Paired with Katie, worked first of all on git collaboration exercises and then on boris-bikes.

I felt we worked well together, we did get stuck for a while on challenge 11 but we debugged effectively.

##### Ruby notes

Class variables are available to **all** instances of a class; instance variables are available only to a specific instance, and can be set on initialisation by def initialize.

##### Feedback

What did I do well?

> Really enjoyed that Iain and learnt so much from you. You're way more advanced with your knowledge and application of it but you brought me along with you and made sure that I was benefitting from the session - which was really appreciated. You gave clear advice when instructing me as navigator. I also appreciated you suggesting we do the GitHub collaboration session at the start. Enjoyed chatting too - good code/chat balance.

What could I do better?

> As an offspring from a Karen I love to complain but it's quite difficult in this instance. You were really brilliant to pair with. If I had to really nitpick I guess when we were tiring towards the end you were slightly racing towards the final answer, but again you did circle round and made sure I understood .

### Reflection

I felt I hit my goals today, and feel comfortable using github to collaborate on projects. It also helps with my thoughts that it's very easy to work in parallel rather than together if you're working remotely on separate documents.

The afternoon work made me realise I need to practice some of the more advanced elements of Ruby and rspec but we should have plenty of opportunity to do that over the course.

In terms of wider course goals, today helped with learning pair programming and TDD. It's also the first day I've really sat down to consider goals at the start of the day and reflect at the end, so helping also with the idea of learning to learn.
