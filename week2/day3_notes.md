By the end of week 2, all developers should be able to:

* Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
* Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
* Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

Goals for today:

No specific goals for today as we have pair programming and workshops with little independent learning time.

### Notes

## Feedback workshop

EQ

Today focussing on self-awareness and self-motivation, along with social skills.

_Teammate goes on coding tangents but I like to focus on task at hand_

* Shit sandwich
* Focus on what's good and what can be improved
* Empathy
* Write down idea and we'll look at it later
* Ask clarifying question, how does it relate to task at hand.
* Emphasise your needs/feelings - I need to stay focused to progress. Frame it as a positive thing they can do to help you.

Understanding feedback, building resiliance and skills

Feedback is information about reactions to a product, a person's performance of a task, or behaviour, _which is used as a basis for improvement_.

Why is it hard to give feedback?

* Don't want to affect relationship or hurt feelings
* Don't want to knock their confidence
* Don't want to negatively affect person
* Difficult to find the correct language to use - don't know what the other person's state of mind is, for example, which might affect how they receive the feedback.
* Difficult to find the right time and space to do it
* If the other person hasn't asked for it then they might not be receptive to it in the first place.

Why is it hard to receive feedback?

* Can be emotionally impactful - not what you want or need to hear at that time.
* Can depend on your mood.
* It sits between 2 of our core human needs - love & acceptance, and learning & growth. There is a tension between these two needs.

How can we make feedback easier?

1. Shift your perspective. There's no negative or positive feedback - only feedback. It's just information - you choose what you do with it. Feedback is kind - its a gift - you use it to improve. It is investing in your future relationship with that person.  Receiver is the one with the power - they are the gatekeeper - they decide whether to take the feedback onboard.
2. Know thyself. Feedback triggers:
* Truth triggers - seems wrong or off target
* Relationship triggers - something about our relationship with the person
* Identity triggers - undermines how we see ourselves
These triggers might make us reject the feedback.
Blind spots - how I see me vs how you see me - shy might be seen as aloof, for example.

How do we build resilience?

* Understand your profile
* Take the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire - happiness-survey.com
* How wide do you swing - how much to your emotions change? What are your energy levels?
* How long does it take to return to baseline if something negative happens to you?
* How long do you hold onto good feelings?
* Self-care first, then the rest of the world.
* Understanding your profile helps dismantle distortions and be more empathetic to others.

3. types of feedback

* Appreciation
* Evaluation
* Coaching

4. Giving feedback

* Feedback should be actionable
* Avoid vague adjectives like "good" or "bad"
* They should be able to take immediate steps to action the feedback

#### Pair programming

Paired with Ian on oystercard; worked on TDD, OO programming, feedback.

#### Process Workshop

Feedback:

* I was very methodical and thorough
* Can improve setup by using platformio
* Refactor!

### Reflection

Good opportunities today to practice giving feedback, as well as improving TDD and OO programming, both from the practical and from the pairing in the afternoon.
