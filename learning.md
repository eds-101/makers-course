## Starting level

My starting point is some experience coding with C, Python, JavaScript, SQL and Ruby, gained from:

* Harvard CS50 course
* Makers pre-course
* Codeacademy Ruby course
* Ruby Koans
* Codewars (Ruby)

I have a small amount of experience of TDD gained from the Makers pre-course.

I understand basic coding concepts such as algorithmic thinking, but lack the skills and experience to properly write clean code and create fully-functional programs.

#### 1. I can make anything

##### 1.1 I can TDD anything

I have some experience with Ruby and RSpec, but nowhere near enough to be able to make a complex, well-written program.

##### 1.2 I can program fluently

My code is not great. I don't have the required knowledge to write clean code.

##### 1.3 I can debug anything

I understand what debugging is and mostly debug my own simple programs.

##### 1.4 I can model anything

I don't have a full understanding of what the term 'model' means in this specific context.

##### 1.5 I can refactor anything

I can refactor some things, but do not have anywhere near enough experience to be able to refactor anything.

##### 1.6 I have a methodical approach to solving problems

I have a tendency to jump ahead rather than methodically work through every step to solve a problem.

#### 2. I'm equipped for long-term growth

##### 2.1 I manage my own wellbeing

I am generally quite good at this; I make sure that time is dedicated to exercise, family and things I enjoy outside of work.

##### 2.2 I can learn anything by myself

I am reasonably good at this, but don't record learning in a structured manner.

#### 3. I help my teams succeed

##### 3.1 I use an agile product development process

I don't know what agile development is.

##### 3.2 I write code that is easy to change

I almost certainly don't do this.

##### 3.3 I can justify the way I work

I suspect not.

##### 3.4 I grow collaboratively

I have a lot of experience of working with, training, and mentoring others and look forward to using these skills on the course.

## Weekly Progress

### Week 1

[Airtable: TDD & Debugging](https://airtable.com/shrIlMSX4PrGxuSfT/tblokmw6yNUO75ge6)

#### I can TDD anything

Practising TDD with the [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/iainaitken/boris_bikes_friday) and [Airport](https://github.com/iainaitken/airport_challenge) challenges.

Need more experience in writing tests fluently with RSpec, and understanding some of the more complex concepts such as mocking behaviour.

#### I can program fluently

Writing code in the [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/iainaitken/boris_bikes_friday) and [Airport](https://github.com/iainaitken/airport_challenge) challenges.

I need to plan out my programs more thoroughly before writing any code - I need to think more clearly about what the objects in the code will be, and what each will be responsible for.

#### I can debug anything

Debugging in the [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/iainaitken/boris_bikes_friday) and [Airport](https://github.com/iainaitken/airport_challenge) challenges.

Debugging is going well. I am using a methodical approach to debugging and have managed to find all bugs that cropped up this week.

#### I can refactor anything

Some refactoring in the [Airport](https://github.com/iainaitken/airport_challenge) challenge.

#### I have a methodical approach to solving problems

See debugging above.

#### I manage my own wellbeing

Attending meditation classes; regular exercise; switching off in the evenings.

Need to improve this, though - spend both weekend days working on course-related tasks. Aim to work more effectively during week 2, to ensure that one of the weekend days is free from programming.

#### I can learn anything by myself

Independently working through the udemy RSpec course and recording progress [here](https://github.com/iainaitken/courses/tree/main/udemy/testing_ruby).

#### I grow collaboratively

Plenty of opportunities to pair program this week, including outside of the allocated time in the afternoons for this skill. I made an effort to learn how to collaborate on git and try out the driver/navigator style of pair programming.  Feedback for week 1 included:

__Katie__

> Really enjoyed that Iain and learnt so much from you. You're way more advanced with your knowledge and application of it but you brought me along with you and made sure that I was benefitting from the session -  which was really appreciated. You gave clear advice when instructing me as navigator. I also appreciated you suggesting we do the GitHub collaboration session at the start. Enjoyed chatting too - good code/chat balance.

__Sandy__

> I like that you pushed me to try things and not assume anything,
>
> You gave me time to understand the concepts and discuss your understanding of them with me
>
> You taught me a new RSpec marker (.to change { })
>
> I really enjoyed pairing with you
