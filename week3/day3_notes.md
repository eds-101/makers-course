### Notes

#### Battle

[Web forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form)

Web forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a web site or application. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage, or used on the client-side to immediately update the interface in some way (for example, add another item to a list, or show or hide a UI feature).

A web form's HTML is made up of one or more form controls (sometimes called widgets), plus some additional elements to help structure the overall form â€” they are often referred to as HTML forms. The controls can be single or multi-line text fields, dropdown boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons, and are mostly created using the <input> element, although there are some other elements to learn about too.

Form controls can also be programmed to enforce specific formats or values to be entered (form validation), and paired with text labels that describe their purpose to both sighted and blind users.

#### EQ Workshop - Empathy

5 core components of EQ

* Self awareness
* Social Skills
* Empathy
* Self Management
* Motivation

What is empathy?

* Ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes - to sense their emotions and imagine what they are thinking or feeling.

Why is it relevant to coding?

* User accessiblity
* Working in teams
* Sonsidering user stories, code written by other devs etc

Empathy builds trust.

5 disfunctions of a team (pyramid shaped):

* Inattention to results. Instead, focus on outcomes.
* Avoidance of accountability. Instead, confront difficult issues.
* Lack of commitment. Instead, focus on clarity and closure.
* Fear of conflict. Instead, demand and debate.
* Absence of trust. Instead, be human.

Empathy is at the base of this, it underpins trust.

3 types of empathy:

* Affective empathy - feel emotionally connected but not driven to help
* Cognitive empathy - consciously imagining how someone is feeling without internalising it (i.e. doctors with patients.)
* Empathic concern - a mixture of the above two - consciously understanding and internalising the emotions of another person, and driven to help or respond appropriately.

Reasons why empathy might be missing:

* Anger
* Protection - don't want to feel the other person's pain
* Identifying - other person's pain might be too close to home
* Fear of Intimacy - emotionally distant seems easier than risk of vulnerability

How do we train empathy?

1. "Just like me" - we are naturally more empathetic to people we feel we are like. Actively look for similarities. "Just like me, this person is .....".
2. Metta Bhavana - loving kindness meditation.
3. Empathetic Active Listening - .
