By the end of week 3, all developers should be able to:

* Build a simple web app
* Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
* Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
* Explain the MVC pattern

### Notes

#### Debugging

What can we do to debug?

* Stack trace
* Get visibility - use p
* Chrome Dev Tools
* Isolate and manually run the code in a repl
* Take a break
* Find the starting point of the problem
* Google it
* Read the error message and pull out key information
* Ask someone else to look over your code (pair, cohort, coach, stackoverflow etc.)
* save_and_open_page

On capybara, you can use save_and_open_page in your code as a debugger. When capybara hits this point in the code, it will open the page and display it in your browser

#### Clients practical

Can use telnet to create both a server and a client that can talk to each other.

#### Pair Programming

Worked with Kasey on the battle project.

### Reflection

Making progress towards the week's goals, although as everything is new, this feels like a slow process. I am closer to being able to build a web app but I cannot do so from scratch just yet.
