## Week 1

### Boris Bikes

__3 February - paired with Katie__

_What did I do well?_

> Really enjoyed that Iain and learnt so much from you. You're way more advanced with your knowledge and application of it but you brought me along with you and made sure that I was benefitting from the session -  which was really appreciated. You gave clear advice when instructing me as navigator. I also appreciated you suggesting we do the GitHub collaboration session at the start. Enjoyed chatting too - good code/chat balance.

_What could I do better?_

> As an offspring from a Karen I love to complain but it's quite difficult in this instance. You were really brilliant to pair with. If I had to really nitpick I guess when we were tiring towards the end you were slightly racing towards the final answer, but again you did circle round and made sure I understood .

__5 February - paired with Sandy__

_What did I do well?_

> - I like that you pushed me to try things and not assume anything,
>
> - You gave me time to understand the concepts and discuss your understanding of them with me
>
> - You taught me a new RSpec marker (.to change { })
>
> - I really enjoyed pairing with you

_What could I do better?_

> To be honest I want to navigate the way you do, I have nothing to change to it :)

### Airport Challenge

__8 February - Feedback from mentor, Javier__

> You kept the methods clean and clear, not more than 3 lines of code (that’s a rule), perhaps in the refactor you could have the open and close merged into only one method returning a boolean value.
>
> Like you die on the the weather method, you could have and array of the the possible weather and with using .sample() will return a random value instead of making a case statements.
>
> When you have many possible IF statements in one method I will suggest to use an IF-ELSE statements, using only IF could have conflicts as e.g. Two if statements met the conditions in different values, so with a IF-ELSE you can track where your condition met the requirements.
> * Like the way you implemented DOUBLES, well done
> * Not sure if you are checking when the weather is stormy, no to take off
> * Not sure if you are testing for the space of the hangar
> * Use described_class for a better adaptable code
>
> Overall I think you code is really neat and your tests are really good, excellent for being your first weekend challenge. I am really impressed about the readme, well explained the situation and you are right, you could have another class that could have the weather only. Delete spaces you don’t need and/or not relevant comments. Excelente!!!

> * Code was readable
> * Code was neat
> * Try to minimise code if possible.

## Week 2

### Oystercard

__8 February - Feedback from Rorie__

_What did I do well?_

> You explained your code very well. Each time you made a change you clearly stated why you were doing it and what it will do to improve the code/rspec. As a driver, I really liked how you prompting me to think about why were changing the code rather than passively writing out what you were telling me. Building a good rapport with your partner is something which gets overlooked by a few, but it makes the whole process alot more fun and less formal, which you did very well too.

_What could I do better?_

> I really can't think of anything to be honest, was a great session!

__9 February - Feedback from Joey__

_What did I do well?_

> Very good communication and constantly talking through your thought process so I always knew why you were doing what you were doing. great attention to detail as well.

_What could I do better?_

> to be honest I can't really think of anything. except show the cats more!

__10 February - feedback from Ian__

_What did I do well?_

> You were very patient with me and allowed me to work through to a solution by myself (unless I asked).

_What could I do better?_

> Nada - really enjoyed that.  Perhaps explaining what exactly it is the code that you're writing is going to be expected to do, or how exactly the test will work, before executing it.  Otherwise keep it up, people will come out of pairing sessions with you as a better coder!

__11 February - feedback from Christine__

_What did I do well?_

> Iain did really well in thinking about the bigger picture of what the code is trying to achieve, and subsequently planning what should be written next, how the methods could be extracted and then incorporated into the main class. He was also very patient while I questioned the logic of certain methods and the class we were building.

_What could I do better?_

> In the spirit of TDD, I think we should have stuck to the unit test, red, green, refactor process more. What we seemed to have done may have been the opposite which was code, feature test, unit test. Saying that, I think it has been challenging for us to come up with the appropriate tests for some methods using doubles so we were just doing the best with what we could.

__12 February - feedback from Hannah__

_What did I do well?_

> You were very patient and encouraging, and supported me with reading the error messages more thoroughly from the bottom of the stack trace.

_What could I do better?_

> I think maybe taking the driver seat for a little bit just to give my brain a little bit of a break could have helped, but also it was useful for me to do more of the driving. Not much to give you for this question I'm afraid!
